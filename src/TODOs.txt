1) Add extra empty steps so that keys generated in last steps, are also processed. (In Simulator class)
2) Add stateless intermediate stage that simulates the key distribution between stages. (In Topology class)
3) Decide what to do with throughput, complexity_type on stateless nodes. Also merge KeyPartitioner with StatelessNode if needed.
4) Adjust experiments (currently not working)
5) In window.process should we also delete processed keys from self.keys?
6) Issue #6. We can assume that a window is full (so it is processed) 1 step after it expires (i.e, move full and expire 1 step further).
For example, if we have a [0,5] window and keys arrive at step 5, the window will not be processed at step 5 but at step 6. So, if keys 
from other nodes arrive with step 5 too, then the window will stil be active (not processed and not expired) and the keys will be added in the window.
